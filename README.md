# AVR PCF8563 #

This is C library for communication between PCF8563 and AVR uC. Written for Atmega88PA, but should work with other microprocessors without modifications (if it have hardware TWI/I2C interface).

It's implement almost all PCF features:

* Date and time
* Alarm
* Clock out
* Timer
* Interrupt flags

### Setup ###

Just copy library to your project and use it.

Functions are well named so I think long description are not required.
